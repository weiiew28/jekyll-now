title: How to type equations in jekyll
---

I found this link gives a very neat explanation on how you should modify you jekyll to display mathematical equations.
Let us give it a try!

* mathematical symbols: $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$, $$\mathbb{E}$$
* Greek letters: $$ \alpha $$, $$ \sigma $$, $$ \Epsilon $$, $$ \epsilon $$
* Equations: $$ \int_{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2}) dx = 1 $$
