I am a PhD student from the Operations Research Department at Cornell University. My thesis work is on understanding the geometry of some non-convex problems. I studied mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor prior to my grad school.

### More Information

When studying mathematics in my undergraduate years, I have always been attracted by the depth of thoughts and elegant proofs underlying many mathematical objects. It motivates me to understand every single concept until I feel it natural and simple. I have not realized that so many elementary mathematical results stimulate new research results in the filed of machine learning. In particular, I am sometimes a little unsatisfied with myself by using more or less basic calculus and linear algebra in my own research. Nevertheless, I would like to commit myself (1) to learn the frontier techniques and frameworks by reading and writing in order to improve my understanding of the filed; (2) to develop my own insights and unique perspective on integrating technique to solve new problems. I hope this blog will be a playground to stimulate more orignial thoughts from myself.
