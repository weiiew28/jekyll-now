I am a PhD student from the Operations Research Department at Cornell University. I studied mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor prior to my grad school.

### More Information

When studying mathematics in my undergraduate years, I am always attracted by the depth of thoughts and elegant proofs underlying many mathematical objects. It motivates to understand every single concept until I feel it natural and simple. I would like to quote a saying from Richard Feynman as my guiding principle: what I can not create, I don't understand. Therefore, if I can not explain a technique or a theory in a simple/inuitive language, I don't necessarily understand it well enough. If I can't elucidate the relations between an algorithm/technique with other existing methods, then I don't necessarily understand it deep enough.
