I am a PhD student from the Operations Research Department at Cornell University. I studied mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor prior to my grad school.

### More Information

When studying mathematics, depth of thoughts and elegant proofs always attract me. It motivates to understand every single object until I feel it natural and simple. I would like to quote a saying from Richard Feynman as my guiding principle: what I can not create, I don't understand. If I can not explain a technique or a theory in my intuitive language, then I don't understand it. If I can not ask a lot of questions and offer my critiques, then I don't think about it hard enough.
